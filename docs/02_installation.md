## Building from source

The HiveMQ CLI project uses **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)** to build. A gradle wrapper configuration is included, so after cloning the 
[repository](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-cli) from GitHub, simply change into the directory containing the project and execute 

```
./gradlew build
```

## Prerequisites

At least Java 8 is required to run HiveMQ-CLI.

The CLI is implemented with the [11.0.4 Java release](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) which is the preferred version to run this project.
