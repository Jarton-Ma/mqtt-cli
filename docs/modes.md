# Modes

The hivemq-cli can be started in different modes. 
* If just a single publish or subscribe is needed it can be done directly.

`$>hivemq-cli pub|sub ... ``



* If interacting with several clients, using different contextes and publishing and subscribing with them in various ways, 
the shell mode with further sub commands is useful.

``$>hivemq-cli shell``
